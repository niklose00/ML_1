### **How a Decision Tree Regressor Works vs. a Classifier**

While both **Decision Tree Regressors** and **Classifiers** split the data recursively into smaller subsets, the way they handle the target variable differs:

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**              | **Regressor**                                            | **Classifier**                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Target Variable**     | Continuous numeric values (e.g., house prices).         | Discrete categorical labels (e.g., spam/ham).     |
| **Prediction Goal**     | Predict a single numeric value.                         | Assign a class label.                             |
| **Node Criteria**       | Minimize variance or absolute error within each split.  | Maximize purity (e.g., Gini Impurity, Entropy).   |
| **Leaf Node Prediction**| Mean (or median) of target values in that region.       | Majority class label in that region.              |

### **How a Decision Tree Regressor Determines Predictions**

1. **Splitting the Data**:
   - At each node, the feature and threshold that minimize the **error (e.g., variance or absolute error)** of the target values are chosen for splitting.

2. **Recursive Partitioning**:
   - The process continues recursively, dividing the dataset into smaller regions.
   - This stops when a stopping criterion is met (e.g., `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`).

3. **Leaf Nodes**:
   - Each leaf node contains the subset of data points that remain after all splits.

4. **Prediction**:
   - For a new data point, the tree traverses based on the decision rules until reaching a leaf node.
   - The prediction is:
     - **Mean** (default) or **median** of the target values in the leaf node.

### **Example: Decision Tree Regressor**

#### Training Data:
| **Feature**: `RoomCount` | **Target**: `HousePrice` |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 2                        | 300,000                 |
| 3                        | 350,000                 |
| 5                        | 500,000                 |
| 6                        | 550,000                 |

#### Splitting Process:
1. **Split 1**: `RoomCount <= 3`
   - Left Node: `[2, 3]` â†’ Average HousePrice = 325,000.
   - Right Node: `[5, 6]` â†’ Average HousePrice = 525,000.

#### Inference:
- For `RoomCount = 4`, traverse the tree:
  - `4 > 3` â†’ Go to the right node.
  - Predicted HousePrice = **525,000**.

### **Visualization of the Process**

A decision tree regressor with splits based on `RoomCount`:

```
            RoomCount <= 3
           /               \
    Mean: 325k           Mean: 525k
```

### **How it Differs from a Classifier**
1. A **classifier** would assign a **class label** (e.g., "Cheap" or "Expensive") to each leaf node based on the majority of data points in that region.
2. A **regressor** instead computes the **average or median** of the numeric target values within a leaf node.

---

### **Conclusion**
A **Decision Tree Regressor** predicts numeric values by minimizing the error (variance or absolute error) in the target variable at each split. Unlike a classifier, it doesnâ€™t predict categories but computes the average or median of the target in a leaf node for inference.
